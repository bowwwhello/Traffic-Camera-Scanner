# Traffic-Camera-Scanner

This program scans all publicly available traffic cameras. Given a set of coordinates, the program will be able to calculate all traffic cameras and list them out from closest to furthest.
This program has rate limit protections and does not allow for api spam. Once a camera is selected as directed from the console, a snapshot of the camera is taken and saved to the specified folder as dictated by the logging directory.
